        <h2>Twice Baked Potato</h2>
        <div class = "overview">
        <p><b>Origin:</b> South America</p>
        <p>

        <p>
          These twice-baked potatoes work perfectly as a simple, crowd-pleasing entrée or as a rich
          side dish. It is believed that baked potatoes originate from South America, or more
          specifically, Peru. The Inca Indians in Peru were said to be the first to originally
          cultivate potatoes and when the Spanish conquistadors conquered Peru, they brought the
          potato to Europe.
        </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
          <li>8 slices bacon</li>
          <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
          <li>½ cup milk</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
          <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
          <li>8 green onions, sliced, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of
            your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly
            brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions
            to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions,
            and bacon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted,
            about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt,
            lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until
            well-coated.
          </li>
          <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a high-sided baking pan or roasting tray with
            parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them over the
            prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help
            distribute the heat more evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on
            the edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, then sauté the onions,
            ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned. Add the cumin, turmeric, coriander,
            paprika, chili powder, and garam masala and stir constantly for about 30 seconds, until
            the spices are fragrant. Stir in the tomato puree, tomato sauce, and 1 ¼ cups of water,
            then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce, cooking for another 1-2
            minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
