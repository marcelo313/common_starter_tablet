    <p>
      Ador is a yellow looking cat, and he really enjoys headrubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adors favorite food is cat food, this is because he is a cat so therefore
      he likes cat fod.

    <p>
      Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just
      gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives
      to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I
      can only describe him as goofy and chaotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don’t know whether or not it’s because his vet is an
      MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he
      goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7
      years.

    <p>
      Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit
      enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours.
      He also likes going for occasional swims.
    </p>
    <p>
      As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and
      watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.

      <h2 class="pet-name">Honey</h2>
      <div class = "overview">

    <img
      src="images/pets/honey-main.jpeg"
      alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left."
      width="400">

    <p>
      Honey’s favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and
      half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my
      brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we
      come up for air.
    </p>
    <p>
      While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even
      chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock
      thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks
      from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a
      walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one
      other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in
      the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub.

          <h2 class="pet-name">Milktea</h2>
          <div class="overview">
              <img src="images/pets/milktea-main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="400">
              <p>
                  Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and
                  refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of
                  any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be
                  translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty
                  for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
              </p>
              <p>
                  Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder
                  intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold
                  because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage
                  accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even
                  walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while
                  sacrificing the animals’ health.

              <p>
                  Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

              <p>
                  Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet, he is doing great!
              </p>
              <p>
                  My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy, he is happy to be held.
