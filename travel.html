        <p>
          The Apostle Islands are a collection of 22 islands in Lake Superior located in the
          northern region of Wisconsin, USA. Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people,
          the islands contain over hundreds of years worth of rich Native American history. In 1970,
          21 of the islands and the surrounding waters were designated as the Apostle Islands
          National Lakeshore, a protected area managed by the National Park Service. Lastly, the
          islands are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including, white-tailed deer, black bears
          and various bird species.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are six lighthouses spread across the islands, making it one of the largest
          collections of lighthouses in the United States. When the island receives visitors it is
          viewed as a popular destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, sailing, hiking
          and camping. In addition, many people enjoy other activities such as berry picking.
          Camping is also allowed in 19 of the 21 islands to date.
